# Features
They seems like feature to me (at least) :smiley:
- _Mails can be sent to anyone who is **registered** on this web app, dosen't matter if they registered while being on localhost or on any local network !!_ Advantage of using cloud database :wink:
- _Even if you are on localhost, if you are connected to the internet, you will recieve mails_ :upside_down_face:
- _Anyone can simply clone the repo, install node modules, do `npm start` and you can use the app and any other email sending application!!_ :grin: _(Not literally though)_ :zany_face:
